
* Stages of planning.

    1. Figure out mechanics and how to program them <-- Here now
    2. Begin coding mechanics
    3. Play through
    4. Get feedback, use feedback
    5. Repeat till problems fixed
    6. Add more mechanics, "if time"
    7. Repeat 4-5 till problems fixed
    8. Story and more text
    9. Repeat 4-5 till problems fixed

* What is the main theme?

    - Christmas
    - Text based adventure/chance

* What is the goal?

    - Get the highest score in the end of the game, by collecting the most priced presents
    - Steal and replace presents with other objects

* What is the game mechanics?

    -Get random houses, decide if it's worth it or not to go in and Steal
    -Sneak out and in houses, steal and replace the presents or present
    -Get random presents


* If more time.

    - Add risk when entering homes, risk of being discovered, "homes with more risk has higher worth presents"
    - Lose presents is discovered depending on risk in that house, "homes with higher risk drops more presents"
    - The higher risk houses has less chance to appear
    - Add random "abilities" that can be found in houses, example "Open presents before making your choice", "Be undetected", 
    - Can only own one "ability" at a time


^ How to program?

    > Random house.
        >Could make this as a def?

        < Make a list that saves the houses as different values
        < Assign a set of numbers to the different houses depending on their chance of being selected
        < Randomize a number use a if statement to check and call the house that got chosen from list
        < Print and use input to see if the player wants to reroll or not
        < Make a while loop with if statement in, to check if player writes a or b, rerolls if b, goes into house if a

        > Escape house
            < Make a function for escaping or running from house - Need to research on that one
        
        < Create an if statement that checks if your inside or outside of house X
