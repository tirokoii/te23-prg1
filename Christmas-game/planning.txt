
* Stages of planning.

    1. Figure out mechanics and how to program them <-- Here now
       > Try out the figured mechanics <-- And here
    2. Begin coding mechanics <-- Started
    3. Play through
    4. Get feedback, use feedback
    5. Repeat till problems fixed
    6. Add more mechanics, "if time"
    7. Repeat 4-5 till problems fixed
    8. Story and more text
    9. Repeat 4-5 till problems fixed

* What is the main theme?

    - Christmas
    - Text based adventure/chance

* What is the goal?

    - Get the highest score in the end of the game, by collecting the most priced presents
    - Steal and replace presents with other objects, you start with 10 objects

* What is the game mechanics?

    -Get random houses, decide if it's worth it or not to go in and Steal
    -Sneak out and in houses, steal and replace the presents or present
    -Get random presents


* If more time.

    - Add risk when entering homes, risk of being discovered, "homes with more risk has higher worth presents"
    - Lose presents if discovered depending on risk in that house, "homes with higher risk drops more presents"
    - The higher risk houses has less chance to appear
    - Add random "abilities" that can be found in houses, example "Open presents before making your choice", "Be undetected", 
    - Can only own/have one "ability" at a time, after use it breaks
    - Add a function where you can obtain more objects to switch presents with when entering houses.
    - Add a function that saves high scores.


^ How to program?

    > Random house.
        >Could make this as a def, so that it's recallable

        < Make a list that saves the houses as different values
        < Assign a set of numbers to the different houses depending on their chance of being selected
        < Randomize a number use a if statement to check and call the house that got chosen from list
        < Print and use input to see if the player wants to reroll or not
        < Make a while loop with if statement in, to check if player writes a or b, rerolls if b, goes into house if a

            > Escape house
                < Make a function for escaping or running from house - Need to research on that one

        < When player walks out reroll house function 

    > Take presents
        < I want the 
        < Randomly pick a number between 5-10 and take that number of presents
        <


        > Replace presents
            < A list with the objects in your bag, 10 objects




        < When and if all objects are gone, the game ends
    
    > End game
